title: About Ji-Young Youn
---
Dr Ji-Young Youn is a Scientist in the Molecular Medicine Program at The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) Research Institute.

Ji-Young earned her B.S. in Bioengineering from Yonsei University in South Korea in 2004. Through her brief internship experience in the laboratory of Dr. Joe Ecker at the Salk Institute in U.S., she became interested in pursuing research in Molecular Biology. This led to working as a research assistant in the laboratory of Dr. Sarah Liljegren at the University of Chapel Hill, North Carolina.

She completed her PhD in the laboratory of Dr. Brenda Andrews at the University of Toronto in 2013. She focused on functional genetic interaction studies of kinase-regulated pathways and characterization of BAR domain proteins involved in endocytosis. Following Ph.D., she switched fields to functional proteomics, working in the laboratory of Dr. Anne-Claude Gingras at the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute in Sinai Health Systems. Her postdoctoral studies focused on investigating the constituents of cytosolic RNA granules in human cells.

In the summer of 2020, she joined the SickKids Research Institute to establish her lab.
