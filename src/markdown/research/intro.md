Living cells adapt to changing conditions in a dynamic fashion. One mechanism of cellular adaptation is to coordinate intracellular biological processes accordingly, which are often compartmentalized in specific subcellular locations. In order to understand how biological processes are modulated in changing conditions, we survey how the molecular machineries - specifically the proteins - in subcellular compartments change in response to external stimuli or stress.
