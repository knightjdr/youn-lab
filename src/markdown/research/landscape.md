We survey the proteome inventory of various sub cellular compartments in neurons, focusing on organelles essential for their specialized signal transduction function. Starting with RNA-containing compartments and organelles localized to postsynaptic termini, we aim to obtain a high-resolution, proteomic map of neuronal compartments through systematic BioID method.

We are also developing BioID approaches in animal model organisms, such as flies and worms, to survey spatial proteome of neurons in the context of a whole organism. We can further elucidate changes in spatial proteome of specific compartments during development and ageing.
