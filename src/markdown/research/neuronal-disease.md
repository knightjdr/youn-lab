We investigate how Stress Granules and related RNA-containing compartments contribute to the disease progression of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases genetically and functionally linked to Stress Granules. We are currently focused on understanding how the proteomes of Stress Granules and their related RNA-containing subcellular compartments are altered in disease-affected neurons using the BioID approach. This will provide comprehensive view of how disease-causing mutations alter the spatial proteomes of subcellular compartments involved in RNA metabolism and contribute to ALS-FTD disease progression.
