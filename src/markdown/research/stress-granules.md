Stress Granules are dynamic biomolecular condensates formed by liquid-liquid phase separation of translationally repressed mRNAs and proteins, modulating the transcriptome and the proteome during stress conditions. Stress Granules vary in composition and size, showing context-dependent variability. However, it is unclear how several hundreds of Stress Granule proteins coalesce in such specific and regulated manner that are fine-tuned for each cell type and stress. In order to address part of this question, we aim to understand the make-up and organization of Stress Granules in different cellular contexts. We utilize proximity-dependent biotinylation technique, called BioID ([22412018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22412018), [29395067](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29395067)), to probe many different subdomains of the organelle and obtain comprehensive view of the organelle architecture under different conditions. Complemented by affinity-purification coupled to mass spectrometry, we aim to also obtain comprehensive network information of protein-protein interactions mediating the assembly and organization of Stress Granule proteome. This systematic approach will help us understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation and dissolution of Stress granules, which will relate to many other multicomponent biomolecular condensates in the cell.
